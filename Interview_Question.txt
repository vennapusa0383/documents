why service registry in microservices unlike monolithic

one of the service you want to register with service registry - how you will register

let's say we have lot of services and one of the service getting high traffic then we need to scale that particular service - how you will do that

what are the transaction isolation and propogation levels

===================================================
TRANSACTIONAL MANAGEMENT IN SPRING BOOT

>SPRING BOOT OVER SPRING ADVANTAGES ?
->(default server,and annotations , Automated Spring configuration, no- xmls,Starter dependencies,Easier customization and management )

>TYPES OF IOC CONTAINER IN SPRING ?
-> beanfactory and applicationcontext

WHICH ONE [BEANFACTORY AND APPLICATIONCONTEXT] SUPPORTS LAZY AND EAGER LOADING AND GIVE AN EXAMPLE TO PROVE IT
-> The @Lazy annotation has been present since Spring version 3.0(APPLICATIONCONTEXT) There're several ways to tell the IoC container to initialize a bean lazily.When we put @Lazy annotation over the @Configuration class, it indicates that all the methods with @Bean annotation should be loaded lazily.

COMPONENT VS SERVICE ANNOTATION?
-> @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
 @Service annotates classes at the service layer.
 @Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.

> CONTROLLER VS RESTCONTROLLER COMPONENTSCAN
-> @Controller is used to declare common web controllers which can return HTTP response but
 @RestController is used to create controllers for REST APIs which can return JSON.
 In Spring MVC, both @Controller and @RestController annotations are used to define web controllers as per MVC Design pattern.
 
>CAN HAVE 2 MAIN METHOD IN SPRING APPLICATION
-> yes, But need to add the fully qulifed name in buil> pulins>configuration.. in pom.xml

WHAT IS AUTO-CONFIGURATION IN SPRINGBOOT ? HOW TO DISABLE AUTO-CONFIGURATION
-> Auto dependencies are added at time of application creations like h2DB

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE PROFILES IN SPRINGBOOT / PROFILES IN SPRING BOOT?
->(applicatiom.propeties)spring.profiles.active = dev(application-dev.propeties,applicatiom.propeties testing,prod..

IN WHICH SCENARIO YOU WILL GO WITH FEIGN CLIENT AND RESTTEMPLATE?

WHAT ARE THE WAYS DIFFERENT SPRING BOOT APPLICATIONS COMMUNICATE ?
Synchronous Communication.
->Asynchronous Communication(kafka)

WHAT IS THE BEST MODE OF COMMUNICATION FOR DECOUPLING ?
Asynchronous Communication mode.

WE HAVE ANNOTATIONS BASED CONFIGUTAION IS THERE BUT STILL WHY WE NEED TO GO WITH JAVA BASED CONFIGURATION ALONG WITH ANNOTATIONS

LETS IN AN APPLICATION WE HAVE UPLOAD OPTION FOR UPLOADING FILES BUT WE WANT TO ALLOW CERTAIN KIND OF FILES ONLY
->in Multipart file uploading there will be a MiMeType need to setting.

WHAT IS EXECUTERS API IN JAVA AND ADVANTAGE OF IT ?
->The Executor API reduces the execution of the task from the actual task to be executed through the Executors. The java.util.concurrent.Executors class provides a set of methods for creating ThreadPools of worker threads.

NAME 2 CLASSES OF VIEW RESOLVER
-> InternalResourceViewResolver,XMLResourceViewResolver,ResourceBundleViewResolver
<bean id="jspViewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
  <property name="viewClass" value="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView"/>
  <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/"/>
  <property name="suffix" value=".jsp"/>
</bean>


WHAT IS STARTER DEPENDENCY ?
 a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. You get a one-stopâ€“shop for all the Spring and related technologies that you need without having to hunt

HOW YOU WILL CREATE SPRING BOOT WEB PROJECT
-> using the spring starter easy to add the  dependency descriptors in the intail stage.

HOW TO OVERRIDE DEFAULT SERVERS
-> how you will change port

IMPORTANT ANNOTATIONS IN SPRING BOOT
->@springbootApplication @RestController ,@Service ,@Repository, @component @configuration ,@bean

WHAT DETAILS REQUIRED FOR END USERS TO ACCESS AN API
â€“> request and response PAYLOAD

WHAT IS THE USE OF @CROSSORIGIN
